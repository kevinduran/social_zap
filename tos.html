                You will defend, indemnify and hold Social Tap harmless against any loss, damage or costs (including reasonable attorneys’ fees) incurred in connection with claims made or brought against Social Tap by a third party relating to the breach by You of any of Your representations or warranties in these Terms.
                
                Limitation of Liability
                EXCEPT FOR YOUR INDEMNIFICATION OBLIGATIONS IN SECTION 4, UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES WILL SOCIAL TAP, YOU, OR ANY AFFILIATE BE LIABLE TO ANOTHER PARTY FOR INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, SPECIAL, OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES ARISING FROM THESE TERMS, EVEN IF THAT PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES, SUCH AS, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, LOSS OF REVENUE OR ANTICIPATED PROFITS OR LOST BUSINESS.

                Fees and Renewal
                Billing. You authorize Social Tap to charge You the recurring monthly subscription fee for the Service You choose from time to time through the My Account page on the Site and any other charges. Any plan changes will be effective as of the billing cycle following that in which in the change was made. For example if You sign up on January 1st for a plan, You are immediately charged for that plan’s fee. If, on January 15, You decide to switch to another plan, You are not charged anything and service level remains unchanged until February 1st. On February 1st, You are charged for the new plan fee and Your service level is adjusted accordingly. You may incur in connection with Your use of the Services, such as taxes or possible transaction fees, to Your credit card.
                
                Price Changes. Social Tap reserves the right to adjust pricing for the Services upon advanced notice to You. Except as otherwise expressly provided for in these Terms of Use, any price changes to Your service will take effect following email notice to You.
                
                Billing Cycle. The subscription fee for the Services will be billed at the time You choose a plan and each subscription thereafter unless and until You cancel Your subscription. Social Tap will automatically bill Your credit card each month on the calendar day corresponding to the commencement of Your subscription. Subscription fees are fully earned upon payment. Social Tap reserves the right to change the timing of our billing, in particular, as indicated below, if Your credit card has not successfully settled.
                
                No Refunds. EXCEPT AS SPECIFICALLY PROVIDED HEREIN, PAYMENTS ARE NONREFUNDABLE AND THERE ARE NO REFUNDS OR CREDITS FOR PARTIALLY USED PERIODS. Following any cancellation, however, You will continue to have access to the service through the end of Your current billing period.
                
                Payment Methods. You may edit Your credit card information by visiting the Site and clicking on the “My Account” link. If a payment is not successfully settled, due to expiration, insufficient funds, or otherwise, and You do not edit Your credit card information or terminate Your account, You remain responsible for any uncollected amounts and authorize us to continue billing the credit card, as it may be updated. This may result in a change to Your payment billing dates. Social Tap may update Your credit card information with information provided by the applicable payment service provider, and You authorize us to continue to charge the subscription fee to the updated credit card.
                
                Termination
                Termination.  You may terminate these Terms at any time by sending us an email at contact@socialtap.us or through the My Account page on the Site. Without limiting our rights specified below, Social Tap may terminate these Terms for convenience at any time by giving You 10 days’ notice via email to Your registered email address. You agree that Social Tap shall not be liable to You or any third party for any termination or cancellation of Your access to or use of the Services and/or the Site, except for a refund of any prepaid fees or charges.
                Effect of Termination.

If You or Social Tap terminate this Agreement, Social Tap does not have an obligation to delete or return to You any of Your information. When this Agreement has been terminated, You are not entitled to a restoration of Your Social Tap account or any of Your information.

Social Tap will have no obligation to refund any prepaid fees or charges unless the access to the Services is terminated by Social Tap or You terminate this agreement for a material breach of its obligations by Social Tap.
