            HOW WE COLLECT NON-PERSONAL INFORMATION
            The Company and its third-party service providers may collect Non-Personal Information in a variety of ways, including:
            
            Through Your browser: Certain information is collected by most browsers, such as Your Media Access Control (MAC) address, computer type (Windows or Macintosh), screen resolution, operating system version and Internet browser type and version.
            
            Using cookies: Cookies allow a web server to transfer data to a computer for recordkeeping and other purposes. We use cookies and other technologies to, among other things, better serve You with more tailored information, to facilitate Your ongoing access to and use of the Site, and to provide You with personalized marketing. If You do not want information collected through the use of cookies, there is a simple procedure in most browsers that allows You to decline the use of cookies. Some features of the Site may not work properly if You decline the use of cookies. To learn more about cookies, please visit http://www.allaboutcookies.org/
            
            While You may disable the usage of cookies through Your browser settings, we do not change our practices in response to a “Do Not Track” signal in the HTTP header from Your browser or mobile application. We track Your activities if You click on advertisements for Airbnb services on Third-Party platforms such as search engines and social networks, and may use analytics to track what You do in response to those advertisements
            
            Using pixel tags, web beacons, clear GIFs or other similar technologies: These may be used in connection with some Site pages and HTML-formatted email messages to, among other things, track the actions of Site users and email recipients, measure the success of Company’s marketing campaigns and compile statistics about Site usage and response rates.
            
            From You: Information such as Your location, as well as other information, such as Your preferred means of communication, is collected when You voluntarily provide this information. Unless combined with Personal Information, this information does not personally identify You or any other user of the Site.
            
            1.   Information collected via Technology
            In an effort to improve the quality of the Service, we track information provided to us by Your browser or by our software application when You view or use the Service, such as the website You came from (known as the “referring URL”), the type of browser You use, the device from which You connected to the Service, the time and date of access, and other information that does not personally identify You.  We track this information using cookies, or small text files which include an anonymous unique identifier.  Cookies are sent to a user’s browser from our servers and are stored on the user’s computer hard drive.  Sending a cookie to a user’s browser enables us to collect Non-Personal information about that user and keep a record of the user’s preferences when utilizing our services, both on an individual and aggregate basis.  For example, the Company may use cookies to collect the following information:
            
            The Company may use both persistent and session cookies; persistent cookies remain on Your computer after You close Your session and until You delete them, while session cookies expire when You close Your browser.
